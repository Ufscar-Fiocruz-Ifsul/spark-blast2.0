First you have to execute SparkBLAST:


Create the script: nano src/main/scala/SparkBlast.scala

Compile then: sbt package

Execute so: spark-submit --executor-memory qtd-memory --driver-memory qtd-memory --num-executors num-executor --executor-cores 1 
          --driver-cores num-cores --class SparkBlast target/scala-2.10/simple-project_2.10-1.0.jar num-cores 
          "/home/hadoop/blastall/bin/blastall -p blastp -d /home/hadoop/spark-install/bin/database.fa -e 1E-05 -v 1000 -b 
          1000 -m 8" input output

After this you need to find RBH, so execute then:

The Rbh.java script separates and writes to a file only the RBH.

The Rbhsoap.java script that goes in the NCBI and returns the name of the microorganisms and their function.

The RbhOrganismo script that does the comparisons.


Done, you have your RBHs.
